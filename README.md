# Agora

A Go Package that contains a bunch of helper functions to make using the DGraph Go Client a bit easier. 

The official DGraph client:

## Origin ##

The word "Agora" means a public open space used for assemblies and markets. 

I imagined how a graph database could represent all of the people at the market and all the items for sale. So I thought it was a cool word to use for a graph related package. 

## TODO ##

* Add Go Module Support
