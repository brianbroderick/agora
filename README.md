# Agora

A Go Package that contains a bunch of helper functions to make using the DGraph Go Client a bit easier. 

The official DGraph client:
https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgo

## ENV Variables ##

The following ENV variable determines where it looks for Dgraph by default. Dgraph gRPC uses port 9080 by default and 8080 for HTTP calls (i.e. Ratel). 

DGRAPH_HOST=127.0.0.1:9080

## Origin ##

The word "Agora" means a public open space used for assemblies and markets. 

I imagined how a graph database could represent all of the people at the market and all the items for sale. So I thought it was a cool word to use for a graph related package. 

## TODO ##

* Add Go Module Support
